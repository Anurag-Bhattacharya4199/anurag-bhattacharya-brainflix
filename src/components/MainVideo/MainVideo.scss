Description:
This is the MainVideo.scss file
In this file, the styling of the main video component
Diving Deeper Notes:
- I completed the Diving Deeper of Sprint 1, which is dynamic time for the video details and comment details
- Though, it was not asked, but, in a multi-page application with routes, added a Error page for any wrong routes
- Unable to figure out the Diving Deeper of Sprint 2 to make the Comments Form functional
